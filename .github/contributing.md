## Development Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stoe/action-reporting-cli.git
   cd action-reporting-cli
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests to verify your setup:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

### Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code
  - `github/`: GitHub API interaction classes (Enterprise, Owner, Repository, Workflow)
  - `report/`: Report generation modules (CSV, JSON, Markdown)
  - `util/`: Utility functions for logging, caching, and rate limiting
- `test/`: Unit tests with corresponding structure to src/
  - `__fixtures__/`: Test data for unit tests
  - `__mocks__/`: Mock implementations for testing
- `cli.js`: Main entry point for the command-line tool

### Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style (we use prettier and ESLint)
- Write documentation for new methods, classes, and functions
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and modular (generally under 50 lines)
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Handle errors consistently throughout the codebase
- Keep all lines, including comments, under 120 characters
- Write tests for all new functionality

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) convention for commit messages:

- Use the format `<emoji> <description>`
- Common emojis:
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` for new features
  - üêõ `:bug:` for bug fixes
  - üìù `:memo:` for documentation updates
  - üé® `:art:` for code style/structure improvements
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `:recycle:` for code refactoring
  - ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` for tests
  - üîß `:wrench:` for configuration changes
- Keep descriptions concise and descriptive
- Use imperative, present tense (e.g., "change" not "changed" or "changes")

Examples:

- `‚ú® Add new CSV export format for reports`
- `üêõ Fix pagination issues with large repositories`
- `üìù Update installation instructions`
- `‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor API client for better performance`
- `‚úÖ Add tests for pagination handling`

## Testing

- All new features should include corresponding tests
- Run the test suite before submitting a pull request: `npm test`
- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
- If you're fixing a bug, consider adding a test that would have caught the bug

## Documentation

- Update the README.md with any necessary changes
- Document new features, options, or behavior changes
- Consider updating examples if relevant
- Use a conversational tone that matches the existing documentation
- For command examples, use the format shown in the README (e.g., `my-org/my-repo` for repository names)

## Review Process

- All submissions require review
- You may be asked to make changes before your PR is accepted
- Once approved, your PR will be merged by a maintainer

- [GitHub Pull Request Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)
- [Test documentation](../test/readme.md) for detailed testing information
